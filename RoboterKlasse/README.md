_Roboterklasse_ was an exercise about classes in python (12th grade, high school)
The goal is to create a robot with a name parameter that can move up (north), down (south), left (west) and right (east).
The instructions were to be taken from the user. The class has two only one methode: move() with a distance paramater.
Other points were given for a stop instruction. And also for setting a 10 letters limit for the robot's name.
Extra points are also for steps count :)

_Comment_
I thought that exercise was fun for understand oop. espicially if you want to use it for games. However, I found it to be
a little annoying, because you had to write many "if"s.
